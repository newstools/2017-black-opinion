By Staff WriterBeneficiaries of government grants should sleep a lot easier because their grants will be paid come April 1, President Jacob Zuma said on Friday at the Union Buildings. The president was addressing the media at the President&#8217;s Coordinating Council (PCC) quarterly meeting. The PCC consists of Premiers and the Leaders of the South African Local Government Association (SALGA).&#8220;My problem with that issue is that people are making judgments before the date,&#8221; Zuma said. Zuma said he summoned the Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini and Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan and told them to work on a solution and compile a report on the matter.&#8220;I think the country must just be calm on this matter,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I have instructed the two ministers to work on, and to insure that it happens. There&#8217;s nothing that says it should not happen. If that is the case, then you&#8217;ll realise what will happen; what we will do to those who were supposed to do it, who may not do it. Because, we cannot have old people not getting their money,&#8221; Zuma said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying cool down as a country.&#8221; The president also addressed the issue of xenophobia, reiterating his previous statements that South Africans are not xenophobic and that the problem is that of a scarcity of resources. &#8220;The manner in which we just jump to the conclusion of xenophobia is a problem,&#8221; Zuma stated. &#8220;Why is Europe not said to be xenophobic? They don&#8217;t even want people to enter their borders.&#8221;&#8220;It is just like corruption, if it is done by black people, it&#8217;s corruption. If it is done by business, it&#8217;s collusion. That&#8217;s a problem,&#8221; Zuma said.
