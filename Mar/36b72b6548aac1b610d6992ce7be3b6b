By BO Staff WriterThe Black First Land First movement set Twitter abuzz over the weekend when they accused the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) of selling out.The hashtag was a response and support for an interview by former EFF treasurer general, Magdalene Moonsamy in which she said the EFF had sold out black people after it had given their votes to the Democratic Alliance (DA) in strategic metros after the August local government elections. In Tshwane right now there is crisis. In Johannesburg there is crisis. What has voting with the DA yielded for the Black people of Tshwane? Of Johannesburg? Moonsamy said last week.The EFF responded to Moonsamy in a typically EFF way &#8211; saying she was sponsored by the Guptas to sow divisions in the movement. They also called her an attention seeker and a pro-Zuma agent &#8211; with EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi saying the movement was proud of their decision to vote with the racist DA.In the hashtag, BLF highlighted how the EFF changed its stance on white capital after it visited Lord Robin Renwick in London.Since meeting with Renwick, EFF has been quite on things like land expropriation without compensation and nationalisation #EFFSoldOut BLACK 1ST LAND 1ST (@Black1stLand1st) March 26, 2017EFF focused on Guptas Must Go and Zuma Must Fall campaigns whch are fully supported by British and Afrikaner imperialism #EFFSoldOut BLACK 1ST LAND 1ST (@Black1stLand1st) March 26, 2017After meeting Lord Renwick, EFF radically altered its anti-imperialist stance and has since become an agent of imperialism. #EFFSoldOut BLACK 1ST LAND 1ST (@Black1stLand1st) March 26, 2017The hashtag trended all of Sunday and this morning as well.Feeling the pressure, the EFF leadership took to Twitter to bash BLF &#8211; not refuting their claims, but, as with Moonsamy, said BLF were Gupta agents.CBLF = #Curry1stMovement Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) March 26, 2017I think this is the ingredient that makes staff riders that that fell off the mighty EFF to tweet #EFFSoldOut. We will never sell out. pic.twitter.com/MFs9VGW0Ws Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) March 26, 2017A political party is a force not because its topics trend on twitter, but because its ideas translate into masses of votes! IG: @MbuyiseniNdlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) March 26, 2017BLF leader Andile Mngxitama correctly noted that &#8220;disciplining&#8221; the ANC was not a rational explanation for giving votes to the white supremacist DA.Giving political power to DA of #ZilleIsRacist means #EFFsoldOut Magdalene is correct. Unless there is a rational explanation. andile (@Mngxitama) March 26, 2017Their pressers are all about mocking and attacking black leaders. Their votes all about handing power to WMC via DA #EFFSoldOut Handsome Xhegu (@themaytrix23) March 26, 2017@EFFSouthAfrica You are no different to Mangope, TereBlanche and Buthelezi did to blacks during the Transional process #Moonsamy #EFFSOLDOUT Thato Hlatshwayo (@iamthatoh) March 20, 2017As Afrikan revolutionaries, we know that white people benefit from the theft of our land. Thus we cannot ally with whites. Thus #EFFSoldOut https://t.co/JsgCEle78L Ncamisile Sibiya (@sibiya29) March 27, 2017
