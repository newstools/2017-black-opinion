By BO Staff WriterYet another South African company has been found guilty of corruption and &#8220;cartel conduct&#8221; by the Competition Commission.The Commission wants Unilever, of which Johann Rupert&#8217;s Remgro has a 25.8% stake, to pay a penalty equal to 10% of its annual turnover for cartel activity with the edible oils &amp; fats producer, Sime Darby.Sime Derby makes household solid vegetable oil, Holsum. Unilever produces Flora, Rama and Stork margarines.According to Remgro&#8217;s website, Unilever s &#8220;net profit&#8221; for the financial year ending 30 June 2016 increased to over R1.5 billion. Unilever ranks as one of Remgro&#8217;s largest assets.The Commission found that Unilever and Sime Derby agreed not to compete with each other in the market for cooking oils and margarine. Speaking on news network, ANN7, Makgale Mohlala, Head of Cartels at the Competition Commission said, &#8220;they agreed that Unilever would sell to retail customers such as PicknPay and Shoprite, and Sime Derby would sell to industrial customers which are manufacturers of products that use the cooking oils and margarine to produce other products.&#8221;Mohlala said this created a division of markets where one company would be active in the market supplying industrial customers while the other would be active in retail. &#8220;This is prohibited interms of the Competition Act,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Cartels raise entry barriers [to industry]&#8221; said Mohlala. He further said &#8220;cartels result in lack of innovation because firms know that their market is secured, they don&#8217;t have to be innovative, bringing in new ideas, new products, because they are going to be selling their products irrespective.&#8221;&#8220;If you have markets that are cartelised, what ever transformation efforts you are trying to implement in the economy, you will get a resistance from the cartels because &#8230; those changes will disrupt their benefits,&#8221; said Mohlala.Read the Competition Commission&#8217;s full statement on the cartel behaviour of these white-owned companies below: Competition Commission charges Unilever South Africa (Pty) Ltd for cartel conductThe Competition Commission (Commission) has referred to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution a cartel case against Unilever South Africa (Pty) Ltd (Unilever) and Sime Darby Hudson Knight (Pty) Ltd (Sime Darby).This follows the investigation by the Commission which found that Unilever and Sime Darby divided markets by allocating specific types of products and customers goods in the market for the manufacturing and supply of bakery and cooking products throughout South Africa.
