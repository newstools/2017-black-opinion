By BO Staff WriterThe Head of Treasury and Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, has been looting the Military Veterans Special Pension Fund between 2009 and 2014.Gordhan is the current Minister of Finance. He was also the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, serving from 2014 2015. He previously also held the Minister of Finance position from 2009-2014 &#8211; a period during which he looted R11 million from the Special Pensions Fund at the Department of Defence and Military Veterans &#8211; an amount he was not entitled to.Evidence of Gordhan&#8217;s theft and corruption emerges from a HAWKS memorandum drafted on 17 March 2017 and leaked today, 23 March. The Head of the Pensions Fund, Marion Mbina Mthembu, confirmed that she had paid Gordhan R11 million. Moreover the Auditor General&#8217;s report for the period 2009 to 2014 does not reflect the amount of R11 million that Gordhan illegally took. Why is this so? Also, why has Gordhan not come out promptly to refute the allegations against him?It remains to be seen if Gordhan, against whom conclusive evidence relating to the theft of the millions exists, is indeed convicted for his crimes and appropriately penalised to a heavy term of imprisonment. But right now there&#8217;s enough on Gordhan that indicates that he be removed without delay from the position of Minister of Finance. To this end let&#8217;s also bear in mind the numerous cases of corruption that Gordhan is implicated in that shows that he is conflicted, compromised and captured by white monopoly by virtue of him having shares in businesses that were responsible for making him Minister of Finance and him having shares in the four major banks that closed the Oakbay bank accounts. In respect of the latter instance he was unable to intervene in the matter of the Oakbay accounts and the banks and thereby reverse the closure of the accounts. The latest revelation indeed vindicates Black First Land First (BLF). The movement has been calling for Gordhan&#8217;s head to roll as an agent of white monopoly capital. We need a Minister of Finance that is not beholden to white capital, it said.BLF President Andile Mngxitama has said that it is not surprising, as indicated in media reports, that the Minister &#8220;may be involved in corruption&#8221;.&#8220;Already&#8221;, as intimated above, &#8220;almost all the banks and corporations he has shares in have been exposed as corrupt entities&#8221;. Furthermore, Gordhan has not relinquished his shares in those banks &#8230; &#8220;and he is happy to enjoy a dividend from corrupt businesses&#8221;, Mngxitama said.He then reiterated BLFs call for President Zuma to fire Pravin Gordhan as Minister of Finance without delay.
