By Staff Writer Beneficiaries of government grants should sleep a lot easier because their grants will be paid come April 1, President Jacob Zuma said on Friday at the Union Buildings.  The president was addressing the media at the President’s Coordinating Council (PCC) quarterly meeting. The PCC consists of Premiers and the Leaders of the South African Local Government Association (SALGA). “My problem with that issue is that people are making judgments before the date,” Zuma said.  Zuma said he summoned the Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini and Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan and told them to work on a solution and compile a report on the matter. “I think the country must just be calm on this matter,” he said. “I have instructed the two ministers to work on, and to insure that it happens. There’s nothing that says it should not happen. If that is the case, then you’ll realise what will happen; what we will do to those who were supposed to do it, who may not do it. Because, we cannot have old people not getting their money,” Zuma said. “That’s why I’m saying cool down as a country.”  The president also addressed the issue of xenophobia, reiterating his previous statements that South Africans are not xenophobic and that the problem is that of a scarcity of resources.  “The manner in which we just jump to the conclusion of xenophobia is a problem,” Zuma stated. “Why is Europe not said to be xenophobic? They don’t even want people to enter their borders.” “It is just like corruption, if it is done by black people, it’s corruption. If it is done by business, it’s collusion. That’s a problem,” Zuma said.
