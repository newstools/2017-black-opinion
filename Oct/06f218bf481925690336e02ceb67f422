By BO Staff Writer As the African National Congress (ANC) December elective conference draws nearer, lines are being drawn more clearly between the radical economic transformation and white monopoly capital supporting factions within the organisation. More recently, the Mpumalanga province has come out to denounce the white monopoly capital supporting Cyril Ramaphosa faction, now known as “CR17”. Read the ANC Mpumalanga province’s full statement below:  ANC MPUMALNAGA PROVINCE DISTANCES ITSELF FROM THE OPPORTUNISM DISPLAYED BY THE FACTION CALLING THEMSELVES CR17 16 October 2017 The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga Province, has been made aware of a text message circulated to branch leaders of the ANC in the Province, mobilising for a rally planned for the 28th of October in Mbombela Stadium and falsely claiming that, the Provincial Chairperson, Cde DD Mabuza will address that rally. The PEC of the ANC in Mpumalanga distances itself from the planned event and opportunism displayed by the faction calling themselves CR 17, and would like to put it on record that no one has communicated with the PEC nor the Provincial Chairperson, Cde DD Mabuza about the planned event. As the PEC, we view this circulating message alleging to represent a certain CR17 campaign and promoting a rally to be allegedly addressed by the Deputy President of the ANC, Cde Cyril Ramaphosa, as a desperate attempt by bona fide factionalists, who are committed to liquidating the ANC through factions. While we respects the right of any member to canvass for his preferred candidate, we strongly condemn the use of false information and the name of our Provincial Chairperson, to advance their preferred candidate’s political fortunes. We call on our members to reject this grouping and the material they have been distributing all over the province in attempts to undermine the authority of legitimate structures and create a false perception that Mpumalanga supports their factional agenda. We also call on all structures of the ANC in Mpumalanga and the entire membership, to continue convening Branch General Meetings and use them as a platform to unite the ANC, and make it a sharp tool for the liberation of Africans in particular and blacks in general.
