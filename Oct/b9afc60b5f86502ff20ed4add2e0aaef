By BO Staff Writer Sipho Pityana has literally run away from debating the Black First Land First (BLF) president, Andile Mngxitama. The much anticipated debate between the two was to be held tomorrow evening at the University of Cape Town (UCT). The topic of the debate, which was organised by the outgoing black SRC, was to be on “state capture and white monopoly capital”. Pityana is the foremost defender of white monopoly capital and leader of the regime change foreign funded Save South Africa. On the other hand, Mngxitama is a known opponent of white monopoly capital. The announcement of the debate was met with great excitement on social media with others saying its a Gupta vs Johan Rupert debate. Others called it “the West vs East debate”. Others predicted that Pityana was going to run away from the debate. Mngxitama at the time, said he was looking forward to debate Pityana, whom he calls an Askari of white monopoly capital. This is the second prominent pro-white monopoly capital leader who runs away from debating Mngxitama. The first was Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) who ducked an open invitation to a debate with Mngxitama.  The pro-white monopoly capital so-called ‘investigative journalism’ group, Amabhungane, has ran away from a debate as ordered by court, with Mngxitama. It looks like the agents of white monopoly capital are terrified to face off with Mngxitama in debate. Many people are disappointed that the debate has been cancelled after raising such excitement. It is clear that those who defend white monopoly capital are only brave to speak to eNCA but never in a democratic space were they need to back up their claims. Sipho Pityana had to run because he was facing a thorough defeat. Other sources say he was even warned by the Oppenheimer family to avoid the inevitable defeat in the hands of Mngxitama.
