By Brian Thekhie Gumede Here it goes: The Economic Hitmen, The Jackals and the Army. This is a tactic the West has used since 1953 to invade & loot countries throughout the world. Guess what, it is happening in South Africa as we speak, it’s in stage two. This is how it works. Stage 1, they first send economic hitmen to go and corrupt a leader of a country and change policies to favour their interests. If stage 1 fails, they go to stage 2. Stage 2, they send the jackals, that’s your CIA, media and intelligence officers to instigate regime change and even assassinate the leader and replace it with a puppet that they control. This is where individuals and organizations are paid to instigate riots and protests. If stage 2 fails, they go to stage 3. Stage 3, they send the army and totally invade, destroy and loot. In Iran 1953, the president, Dr. Muhammad Massadegh, started to regulate oil trade to benefit the people. Stage 1 failed, they sent the jackals and succeeded. In Guatemala 1954, President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman took land back to the people. Stage 1 failed, they sent the jackals. In Ecuador 1981, President Jaime Roldos Aguilera went for the country’s resources, specifically oil, to help the people. Stage 1 failed, they sent the jackals and he was assassinated by means of a plane crash. Two witnesses later died in car accidents before they could testify. In Panama 1981, President Omar Torrijos helped the people and got the Panama canal back to the people. Stage 1 failed. They sent the jackals and assassinated him in May 1981, plane crash via a tape recorder containing a bomb given by the CIA jackals. In Venezuela 2002, Hugo Chavez regulated Venezuelan oil to help the people. In 2002 a coup was organized by the CIA jackals but it lasted for only 48 hours, Venezuelan people wanted Chavez back. They implemented stage 2 again with the media joining, they failed. People were paid to riot in the streets.
