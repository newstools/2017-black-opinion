By Andile Mngxitama  This week it was revealed that America’s Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) will be investigating South African president, Jacob Zuma, his son, Duduzane Zuma and the Gupta family, on allegations of ‘state capture’. The news was met with criticism in some quarters which understand the dangerous role the FBI has played in destabilising black liberation historically. Some blacks celebrated though, and this is due to a lack of understanding of the workings of imperialism. The African National Congress (ANC) will pay heavily for depoliticising the youth in the past 23 years. The black youth is ideologically disarmed and therefore can’t advance nor defend the revolution. Politics have become a game of media showbizz and gossip. That’s why our youth have no problem aligning with American imperialism to conquer their country. The depoliticised youth are easy victims of media propaganda of white monopoly capital.  When politics stopped being about revolutionary theory and education and became about celebrity status and who can wear the latest Louis Vuitton, the youth were thrown into the arms of the enemy. It should not surprise us that there is no revolutionary outrage about the FBI’s direct moves to organise a coup in South Africa.  The youth, bamboozled by propaganda of white monopoly capital on the one hand and assaulted by hunger and despair on the other, are ready soldiers of reactionary manoeuvres. The black youth have no qualms with marching hand-in-hand with land thieves against Jacob
Zuma. This shows you how deep the ideological decay has gone.  The black youth today is generally animated by revelations of personal
scandals and political gossip driven by white owned media to divert attention from the fact that the real war is with white monopoly capital and the land thieves.  We need to go back to building a youth with ideological content or perish as a people.
