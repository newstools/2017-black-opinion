It also mirrors the glaring lack of appetite for transformation especially by big corporates,&#8221; the minister is reported to have said.In the report, the Chairperson of the Commission for Employment Equity, Tabea Nkabinde, says &#8220;We as a Commission will therefore, pursue the promulgation and implementation of Section 53 in earnest to ensure that there is radical economic transformation in the workplace.&#8221;Listed companies in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) are the biggest flouters of the Employment Equity Act, accounting for more than 50% of the companies that have been issued fines for non-compliance.The report is based on 26 255 employment equity reports received from companies across the country, compared to 25,030 reports last year.94.8% of the reports came from the private sector, which represents 5.3 million workers, with non-profit organisations, state-owned enterprises, educational institutions and national, provincial and local government making up the rest of the workforce.The report divides the workforce according to race, gender and disability.
