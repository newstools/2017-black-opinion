By BO Staff Writer Twenty-six Black First Land First members (#BLF26) who were arrested last year at the office of the Public Protector for protesting against white corruption, including the theft of R26 billion from the Reserve Bank, and state capture by white monopoly capital, will appear at the Pretoria Regional Court tomorrow. They are facing charges of public violence, trespassing, kidnapping and intimidation.  When the case was last heard in court on 20 April 2017, the Regional Magistrate issued an order, which was by agreement between the parties, that the defence will make representations to the Senior Public Prosecutor (SPP) for the withdrawal of all charges to which the State will respond by the next court hearing, being tomorrow.  #BLF26 will know tomorrow whether the State will drop all the charges against them, which in any event are bogus, or whether it will proceed with its case.  They maintain that they would make representations to the next level of seniority should the Senior Public Prosecutor decline to withdraw the charges.  “The state does not have a case! We are confident that ultimately all the baseless charges will be dropped”, the movement said.
