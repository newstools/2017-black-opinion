A Facebook post by Ralph SladeWe need to think deep, very deep and check all the directions. It can&#8217;t be that all the wrongs in South Africa (SA) are to be blamed on Zuma, Zuma, Zuma, ANC, ANC, ANC!Here&#8217;s another voice &#8211; Eugene van Wyk &#8211; from those of us who were born in junk status:&#8220;Just on Friday the Treasury department under Pravin Gordhan was exposed of looting R4.83 Billion but we must focus on Zuma. At Eskom 90% of contracts to supply coal are for white owned companies with contracts going for 40 to 50 years, but we must focus on Zuma. Dstv has been found guilty of price fixing and fined R180 million by Competition Commission and they have agreed to pay, but we must focus on Zuma. The banks have been found guilty of rigging and manipulating the rand, but we must focus on Zuma. Absa stole R26 billion during apartheid, just before 1994, but we must focus on Zuma. At SAA only 2% of R24 Billion goes to black owned companies and the rest goes to white owned companies with links to Ramaphosa and Pravin, but we must focus on Zuma. Former SAA CEO Andre Viljoen received R3.6 million on top of a R2.2 million salary and a performance bonus of R1 million although SAA reported a R15 billion loss during his time at SAA, but again we must focus on Zuma. Another former SAA CEO Coleman Andrews received a handshake of R232 million even though SAA reported a loss of R700 million that year, but once again we must focus on Zuma. Minister Lynne Brown just reported that at Eskom, SAA, Denel and at Armsco, 90% of the tenders go to companies owned by white people, but again we must focus on Zuma. South Africa has 5128 dams registered with the department of water and sanitation but only 320 are managed and controlled by the department, who controls the 4808 (dams), who owns your water??&#8230;but again we must focus on Zuma. So on my personal capacity, I say go to hell&#8230;we want economic freedom as black people and Jacob Zuma has shown us the right doors and exposed this fake rainbow nation that is built on lies and at the expense of poor black people.&#8221;
