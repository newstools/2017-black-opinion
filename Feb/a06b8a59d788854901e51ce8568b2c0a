By BO Staff Writer It’s official, former Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe, has been sworn in as an African National Congress Member of Parliament (ANC MP). Molefe, who is credited as having turned around the power utility and stopped the scurge of loadshedding, is rumoured to be heading to the Treasury department. Molefe resigned late last year after the release of the allegations-driven State of Capture report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. In his resignation letter Molefe said, ” [o]bservations made in the report relating to, inter alia, my conduct, are in material respects inaccurate, based on past facts, or simply unfounded.” “I shall dedicate myself to showing that an injustice has been done, by the precipitate delivery of ‘observations’ following an incomplete investigation, which the former public protector has drawn back from calling “findings”. The truth will (come) out,” he said at the time. The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) has welcomed the swearing in of Molefe. PPF president Mzwanele Manyi said on ANN7, “we are really excited about the swearing in of Brian Molefe into parliament.” “We think Brian has the requisite skills and he has a spectacular track record of success. If merit is anything to go by, he has a lot of that.” Manyi was quoted as saying on Monday. On Tuesday the Black First Land First movement joined a chorus of people hailed the swearing in of Molefe as a progressive move. “Molefe is one of the most intellectually gifted and patriotic black managers in South Africa. His track record as an initiator of economic transformation speaks for itself,” the movement said in a statement. “Molefe will certainly assist to infuse a new dynamism and substance to the affairs of parliamentary politics,” BLF said. Acting ANC caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said, “He will be deployed to a relevant committee at an appropriate time after consultation.”
