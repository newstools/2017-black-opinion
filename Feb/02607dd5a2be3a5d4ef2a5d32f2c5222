By BO Staff Writer The 26 Black First Land First (BLF) members arrested last year at the office of the Public Protector  appeared at the Pretoria Regional Court 10 on 02 February 2017. The following order was made by the Regional Magistrate: 1. The case is postponed to 15 March 2017. 2. The defence will make written representations to the Senior Public Prosecutor (SPP) on 10 February 2017 for the withdrawal of all charges. 3. The State will respond to the Defence representations on 22 February 2017. Should the State decide to withdraw all charges there will be no need for #BLF26 to come to court on 15 March 2017. Should the state decide not to withdraw the charge then on 15 March 2017 the #BLF26 will appear in court. On the day, Black First Land First (BLF) said they would make further representations to a higher authority to the Senior Public Prosecutor should the latter decline to withdraw the charges. “BLF is confident that all the charges – being charges of public violence, trespassing, kidnapping and intimidation – will ultimately be withdrawn as the charges against #BLF26 are baseless,” the movement said.
