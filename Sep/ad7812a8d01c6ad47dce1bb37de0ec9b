By BO Staff Writer The owner of the Sunday Times and one of the richest men in South Africa wants Gayton McKenzie, the leader of the Patriotic Alliance (PA), down. Sources from within the Sunday Times have revealed how Johann Rupert has unleashed the newspaper on McKenzie. Rupert is blaming McKenzie for the media expose of Cyril Ramaphosa as well as for the break-up of the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) coalition in Nelson Mandela Bay. Sources say that the Sunday Times crusade against McKenzie and his close business associate, Kenny Kunene, is a dirty game to deal with them once and for all. For two weeks running the Sunday Times has been writing fake and damaging news about the two close friends. One story even said that the two were being trained in Russia to be spies. Part of the dirty war against McKenzie is to project him as a “new Gupta” who controls President Zuma. Rupert hopes that the banks will unleash their monopoly power to shut down the businesses of McKenzie just like they did with the Guptas. Rupert is said to be on a war path and can’t wait to see McKenzie go down. Last Sunday a new story was manufactured by the Sunday Times. The story involves claims of a R5 billion oil deal. It seems that Rupert and white monopoly capital are worried that McKenzie and Kunene may be getting into the big league in the economy. The Sunday Times was shocked that its attempts to smear McKenzie and Kunene backfired as the majority of Twitter users praised the two black businessmen. This has led to the Sunday Times changing its headline. The Sunday Times is exposed as a rogue bulldog of white monopoly capital against any black person fighting for black empowerment. McKenzie has threatened to sue the paper. All indications are that in Gayton McKenzie white monopoly capital has met its match. South Africa better prepare for an epic war!
