By BO Staff Writer The following article was first published earlier today on the BLF website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) to reject the desperate and dishonest call by the South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) to reconsider its position to boycott the Tiso Blackstar stable. This call by SANEF is disingenuous. It is based on the refusal to accept bad journalism and the insults which had been directed at the church and its leadership – in particular His Grace the Right Reverend Bishop, Dr Barnabas Lekganyane. BLF says to the ZCC, “press on with the just cause. Lead us all to boycott white monopoly capital so that we can all get justice!” White monopoly capital does not respect the truth or any black beliefs. It has total disregard for the observance and practice of ethical conduct. It only respects its profits. But the ZCC because of its size is able to kick them where it hurts most, in the pockets.
