By Thobile NkoenyaneThis article was submitted as part of the Think For Yourself competition.Who impedes Black advancement? Zuma, the Guptas or White Monopoly Capital? None of the above, or maybe, all of the afore-mentioned. This sounds like a dichotomy, doesn&#8217;t it?There are many reasons why we, as the Black brethren, kana kare, rona Thari ye Ntsho, find ourselves in the hole that we find ourselves in currently.Us. Thina. Rena kaborena. Yes, you heard me, we did this to ourselves.We were too focused on gaining political freedom,we completely forgot about economic freedom. These two freedoms, ought to have been fought for, TOGETHER, in unison. Truth be told, we should have adopted the Afrikaner&#8217;s model of emancipating their people, after the entire Anglo-Boer war. That model, has worked wonders for the Afrikaners.I do conceed that, probably, the freedom fighters from days of yonder, had nothing good to see from the Afrikaners, by the Afrikaners, as they (the Boers) were the primary enforcers of apartheid laws. Perhaps, that is the reason why, the Afrikaner model, was never looked at back then. It is only now, in hindsight, that we (yes, we, rena, bathobaso) see that, it could have been applicable to us, and we would have been so far, had we adopted it.I am still adamant that, we are the reason we are in this mess.The way we implemented BEE, GEAR, ASGISA, was not kosher. All these benefitted an elite few, who were politically connected. Sadly, this is still applicable even today. The only slight difference is that we call it &#8220;being captured&#8221;, either by the Guptas or by White Monopoly Capital. Either way, we (the politicians and those in positions of influence) are captured. The one who dangles the juiciest carrots, gets to have the puppets dance to his music, as and when he pleases.Zuma did not do this. The Guptas did not do this to us. White Monopoly Capital did not do this us.We did this to ourselves, as Black people.
