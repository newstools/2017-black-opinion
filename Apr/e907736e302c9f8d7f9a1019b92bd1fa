&nbsp;The Minister of Finance, Comrade Malusi Gigaba, was appointed in that position to advance the agenda of Radical Economic Transformation (RET) as broadly as it was outlined by President Zuma in his State of the Nation Address (SONA). The removal of the pro white monopoly capital previous Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, was effected to create the opportunity to realise the vision of RET. Minister Gigaba naturally has the mission to appease the people through RET and to this end not worry about the market&#8217;s and the criminal rating agencies.&nbsp;Black First Land First (BLF) applauds Minister Gigaba for his prudent and well considered choice of Professor Chris Malikane as his advisor. This appointment shows that the Minister is serious about RET. BLF hopes that the Minister of Finance will disregard the right wingers who have started demonising Professor Malikane for his radical posture. In this regard we humbly appeal to Minister Gigaba to listen to the advice of Prof Malikane.&nbsp;Reports indicating that the Minister will be going to London, New York and Washington D.C but skipping Delhi, Moscow and Beijing does not send a good signal about his commitment to RET. Evidently, Minister Gigaba is spending too much time with the enemies of RET. The rating agencies are criminal organisations which must be totally disregarded. One simply can&#8217;t push radical economic change and be a slave to the rating agencies at the same time. The choice that the Minister has is between the people and the markets, and the only viable option is the people!&nbsp;What is even more shocking is the fact that Gigaba will be consulting the evil International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) &#8211; the same two institutions which are opposed to the RET. As if that is not enough the Minister will again meet the same criminal organisations, called rating agencies, which are part of the regime change agenda of imperialism. Gigaba needs to know that you can&#8217;t appease the devil.&nbsp;We call on Minister Gigaba to reject the West and embrace BRICS. We expect the Minister to be in Beijing and negotiate the extension of credit from China so as to refinance the national debt and free the country from imperialism.&nbsp;The first message must be that South Africa (S.A) shall free itself from the tyranny of the rating agencies as well as the brutal policies of the IMF and the WB. The Minister needs to show resolve and leadership and to this end not be intimidated by the empty threats of the West and its bulldogs, the rating agencies.&nbsp;BLF calls for the following:&nbsp;1. Nationalisation of the Reserve Bank;&nbsp;2. Land expropriation without compensation;&nbsp;3. Delinking from the West via refinancing of the national debt through loans from China under favourable terms;&nbsp;4. Expulsion of rating agencies from S.A;&nbsp;5. Rejection of the IMF and the WB;&nbsp;6. Creation of a State Bank now;&nbsp;7. Licensing of black banks; and&nbsp;8. Removal of state bank accounts from ABSA!&nbsp;The above are some of the minimum demands that the Minister cannot dodge.&nbsp;BLF will write a letter asking a meeting with the Minister as soon as he returns to the country. President Zuma has given clear direction on RET. We need Minister Gigaba to show that he is up to the task.&nbsp;We call on Minister Gigaba to abandon the West and embrace the people &#8211; it is his historic mission! He can&#8217;t fail the people yet again!&nbsp;Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC)&nbsp;18 April 2017&nbsp;Contact details&nbsp;Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.comFacebook: Black First Land First | Twitter: @black1stland1stWebsite: www.blf.org.za&nbsp;Zanele Lwana(National Spokesperson)Cell: +27 79 986 7225&nbsp;Lindsay Maasdorp(National Spokesperson)Cell: +27 79 915 2957&nbsp;Brian Tloubatla(Deputy National Spokesperson)Cell: +27 82 216 7664
