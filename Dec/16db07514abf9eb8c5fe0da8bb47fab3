By BO Staff Writer The racist Democratic Alliance (DA) of Helen Zille has been lying about a “secret meeting” between the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and MultiChoice. It issued a false statement claiming that some minutes of a secret meeting has been discovered. Where have you seen a secret meeting with minutes? The DA lying about MultiChoice is part of a strategy to bully the company into dumping ANN7. Now the DA is resorting to dirty tactics in its desperation to try and shut down ANN7. White Monopoly Capital and the London controlled opposition parties want ANN7 shut down. From the richest woman in the country who is a Polish migrant, Magda Wierzycka, to the racist so-called civil society Organization Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), to the pro colonialist DA and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) – they all can’t bear the majestic voice of ANN7. Wierzycka is the first to attack using her financial power. They are all brazen and open about censoring views which do not accord with the white agenda. The shocking thing is the silence of the media freedom organizations such as the Freedom of Expression Institute (FXI) and its loud Right2Know Campaign (R2K).
The silence of the South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) is the worst of all. It is clear that by media freedom they mean the freedom to broadcast only pro white monopoly capital views. The sin of ANN7 is that it has become an avenue for alternative and pro black views. There is no need for the DA to lie. They have on their side the biased eNews Channel Africa (eNCA) and now a pro opposition parties board at the SABC. The BLF President, Andile Mngxitama, has asked, “why can’t they keep their eNCA and let us keep our ANN7?”. White Monopoly Capital wants to have monopoly over creating public opinion. The DA wants the public to remain ignorant and fed one side of the story. Media freedom must be protected.
