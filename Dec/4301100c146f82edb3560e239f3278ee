By BO Editorial Collective 2017 was a year filled with great revolutionary potential. We saw moves towards the unification of the black bloc through the bolstering of the Radical Economic Transformation program. We saw growths of radical movements like the Black First Land First (BLF) movement. We saw a strict line being drawn between those who want to keep blacks in subjugation through white monopoly capital, and those who are for black liberation through radical economic transformation. We saw the first female candidate for the African National Congress (ANC) presidency courageously pushing for the emancipation of the black majority. We saw the president calling for the expropriation of land without compensation and declaring free education! Equally, 2017 showed us how white monopoly capital continues to make inroads and entrench its power. We saw a self-proclaimed socialist revolutionary party, which is supposed to advocate for land, giving black votes to a white racist anti-black party, and thus bolstering white racists to continue with their racism. We saw multiple attempts at a coup by the opposition. They wanted to forcibly remove a democratically elected president. We saw more evictions, more gender based violence and more exclusion of poor, landless blacks from the economy.  This year, Black Opinion turned one. We had close to 2 million people reading and engaging with the work we put out daily. We saw more and more black writers contributing to this platform with fierce ideas and words. We thank you! We would like to thank the more than 5000 people who have liked our Facebook page and have contributed to engaging conversations. We also thank our 4500 Twitter followers who not only engage us, but who we learn a lot from too.  May we, as black people, continue to fight for our freedom. Our land. Our dignity.  May you all enter the new year safely. Bolekaja!
