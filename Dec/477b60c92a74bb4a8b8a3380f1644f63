By BO Staff Writer The former leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA), Tony Leon, has shocked the twitter world by revealing that Cyril Ramaphosa was bought by white monopoly capital. Leon tweeted that he knows for a fact that a big land owner gave Ramaphosa R30 million to kill Radical Economic Transformation (RET), more specifically land expropriation without compensation.  It is clear from the tweet that white monopoly capital had sponsored the CR17 campaign to ensure that Ramaphosa emerges so that the pro RET candidate, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, is stopped. It is evident that the NDZ campaign was up against billions of rands by white monopoly capital. The shocking news that the President of the African National Congress (ANC) has accepted money from a big land owner raises serious questions about whether he can champion land expropriation without compensation. Ramaphosa is clearly captured by white monopoly capital. It remains to be seen if any action will be taken against Ramaphosa for taking this money with the promise of protecting land thieves. Â
