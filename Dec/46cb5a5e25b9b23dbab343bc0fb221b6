Dear ANC delegates I am writing this letter with an open heart. It cannot be right that South Africa (SA) remains a country with the highest inequality in the world and we see it as right. We, as black people of this country, face racism day in, day out. Corruption is only labelled as a black phenomenon. You like it or not, SA is going the war route. However, this historic weekend shall remain the most important days of our lifetime. Take your time and see how the white media wants Cyril Ramaphosa to win. Since when is the white media on our side? Be reminded that this is the same media that stood at the side of the apartheid regime when our people were attacked and oppressed. To believe that today they are on our side through Cyril Ramaphosa’s new deal is an insult to those that died for us to enjoy the freedom we have today. The 54th African National Congress (ANC) conference is not about Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma (NDZ) or Cyril Ramaphosa (CR). It is about the economic liberation of the masses. Your vote is important and you don’t need money to see what is the right thing to do. I am writing this letter with pain, humbly asking you to use your power to defeat white monopoly capital. Cyril Ramaphosa is not representing what you and I stand for, but the strength of the rand and the power of white monopoly capital’s balance sheet. The time is now. It cannot be you that should sell out. Go to Nasrec with pride and do not get intimidated. We put all our trust in you. Help us. Help South Africa. It is our time for Radical Economic Transformation. I wish you all the best. Yours faithfully
