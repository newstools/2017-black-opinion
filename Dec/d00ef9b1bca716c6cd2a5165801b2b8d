By BO Staff Writer 17 December 2017 The Cyril Ramaphosa (CR) faction is trying to collapse the 54th African National Congress (ANC) elective conference. This desperate move follows the overwhelming show of support for Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma (NDZ). The CR17 lobby is in a panic. It is trying to delay the conference as far as possible and collapse it. The writing is on the wall. The NDZ train has the numbers. Sources who are inside the CR17 faction have revealed a three pronged strategy to rob NDZ of a victory. The intention is to firstly heckle on credentials while offering money to the NDZ delegates; and secondly to lobby the chairpersons of five provinces to agree to collapsing the conference. This is the requirement to call a conference off in terms of the constitution. The current status is that the Northern Cape, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Gauteng are in. They are now trying to get Limpopo in, which is refusing. The third leg of the strategy is to go to court and interdict the conference. Apparently, lawyers have already finalized court papers and Judge Dunstan Mlambo is working closely with the CR17 faction to assist with collapsing the conference through the court. Sources says that Johann Rupert and the Oppenheimer family are bankrolling the sabotage. Bidvest, in which Cyril Ramaphosa and Pravin Gordhan have business interests, is alleged to be the entity bribing delegates with money and accommodation at luxurious hotels. These diabolical measures kicked in as soon as the NDZ forces gathered yesterday afternoon and showed their strength. There is panic in the CR17 faction as well as in the white monopoly owned media. The Times was so panicked yesterday it even declared victory for Ramsphosa. The only way Ramaphosa can be President of the ANC is by rigging or collapsing conference through various means, including the court. The big question is whether his faction can succeed in this evil endeavor. Â
