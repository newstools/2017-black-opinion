By BO Staff Writer The white owned media, such as the Sunday Times, are fermenting fake news to instigate the removal of President Zuma. The paper has written a story based on pure lies. This story claims that there is discussion to remove president Zuma by some National Executive Committee (NEC) members of the ANC. Sources have indicated that there is no such discussion going on involving any member of the NEC. White monopoly capital is not happy with the outcome of the ANC elective conference in terms of which its candidate, Cyril Ramaphosa, won the presidency with a narrow margin and has no majority in the NEC. What angers white monopoly capital the most is the fact that the pro Zuma faction had a clean sweep on policy. The conference agreed to the nationalization of the South African Reserve Bank and land expropriation without compensation. These were the policies that white monopoly capital backed Ramaphosa to stop. White monopoly capital is worried that with President Zuma in office these policies of the ANC will be implemented. They want him removed fast so that Cyril Ramaphosa can take control and stall the implementation of Radical Economic Transformation (RET). White monopoly capital is so scared that Zuma will continue where he left off with free education that they are manufacturing lies about his removal with the hope of creating a momentum that may see him being recalled. But such a move has no chance of success given the balance of forces inside the NEC. The reports that there is a move to remove President Zuma are just fake news by the frustrated and desperate white monopoly capital in an attempt to create an environment where the President can be recalled. This is wishful thinking on the part of white monopoly capital after losing the policy battle inside the ANC.
