By BO Staff Writer In the race for who will succeed Zuma in the African National Congress (ANC), it’s clear that white monopoly capital, along with its propaganda arm in the media, favour Cyril Ramaphosa. This is for the obvious reason that Ramaphosa is pro-white monopoly capital.  Ramaphosa, the man who negotiated the “rainbow nation” into existence, is more of a business man than a politician – a Donald Trump of some sorts, who is a centre-right, neo-liberalist.  In preparation for his run for presidency, he quickly said he would sell all his stakes in the multiple businesses that he owned, to avoid a “conflict of interest”. He now has shares in “blind trusts” and in 2015 he sold most of his business interests to a company led by MTN executive Phuthuma Nhleko called Pembani Group. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, in 2012 (just before Ramaphosa sold his businesses to Pembani), the Pembani Group went into a business partnership with Johann Rupert’s Remgro, to form Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Managers Proprietary Limited, which is owned jointly by Johann Rupert, Phuthuma Nhleko and an investment team.  Below are some of the business interests thst Ramaphosa held, which also have deep connections to white monopoly capital and which are regime change advocates. Most notable of these is Lonmin, which was responsible for the deaths of 36 miners in Marikana – deaths which Ramaphosa has never answered for. In 2015, it was reported that “with a fortune of R6.75bn, Ramaphosa is South Africa’s richest black person after Patrice Motsepe, his brother-in-law, according to the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times newspaper.” The business interests that our South African Trump (trade unionist, turned business man, turned politician) has held, include the following: 1.
