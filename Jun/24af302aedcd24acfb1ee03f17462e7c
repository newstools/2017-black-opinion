By BO Staff Writer Today, the white racist opposition party, Democratic Alliance (DA) released a fascistic statement demanding that the public boycott all Gupta-owned media, namely ANN7 and The New Age. This comes after the Treasury expose, wherein ANN7 revealed gross corruption and maladministration in the office under former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan. Black Twitter had a field day mocking the statement, correctly pointing out that the DA has never called for white owned media houses like eNCA and Radio702 to be boycotted. They have never called white media “propaganda media” when almost everyday these media houses call for the removal of a democratically elected president. Twitter users also noted that the DA has not solved the deep running racism in the party, and yet it calls for black owned media to be boycotted. They (@Our_DA) won’t boycott what they run and own … it’s like boycotting your own spaza shop if you had 1, WMC Media is alive through DA — c-Ya Mshengu (@SiyabongaT) June 6, 2017  Stop bullying us Phumzile, @ANN7tv is balancing their reporting unlike your @eNCA, @Radio702, etc. Only news channel I watch — Blacks must unite (@Zwanebs) June 6, 2017  After exposing treasury now this ??? — Melanin Man (@inkuja) June 6, 2017  Nonsense , we’ve never boycotted Sunday Times , ENCA , Mail and Guardian, etc. Stop it — DaughterofZion (@MamakaNoni) June 6, 2017  In the statement the DA says ANN7 & The New Age are supported by state funds and are therefore state defenders. But the DA says nothing about the money from white monopoly capital which white media like Sunday Times receives and says nothing about the anti-black propaganda which white media spews. The second opposition, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has a similar boycott of ANN7 and TNA – but the reds have never boycotted any white owned media company.
