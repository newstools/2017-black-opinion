The following article was previously published on 31 October 2017 on the BLF website and is reissued by BO. The decision by the Johannesburg High Court to give cart√© blanch to the Oppenheimer family to operate a private international airport is a clear indication that the South African judiciary is captured by white monopoly capital. Black First Land First (BLF) has lost all faith in the judiciary. Our judiciary is an arm of white monopoly capital which is used to undermine and to intimidate anyone who wants radical economic transformation and an end to the colonial nature of South African society. BLF is not supprised that a court can allow a private family to operate an international airport of its own. This means the court has given the Oppenheimers the right to steal our diamonds, gold and other wealth, put it in a airplane and transport it to Europe in the same way the Oppenhimers can organise their militia and arm them through contraband. Now, Nicky Oppenheimer can put weapons, drugs and all other dangerous materials on that private plane in pursuit of profits and this has been made legal by our very captured courts in South Africa. If our people are not convinced by this act that the courts remain racist, anti-black, pro-white monopoly capital tools, nothing will convinced them. #LandorDeath ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF THE BLACK FIRST LAND FIRST MOVEMENT (BLF NCC) 31 October 2017 Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com
