The following article was previously published on 31 October 2017 on the BLF website and is reissued by BO. Black First Land First (BLF) acknowledges the revolutionary act of the truck driver who, yesterday, rammed into a settler colonialist racist protest of Afriforum, Democratic Alliance (DA) and white monopoly capital (WMC). Such an act shows that our people will not fold their arms when those who stole our land look down upon us, abuse us and undermine our very existence. The truck driverâ€™s actions, intension not withstanding, are revolutionary in themself. We salute the driver and insist that he must be protected, he was just doing the work of God.
