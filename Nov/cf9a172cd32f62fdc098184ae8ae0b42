By Adv Sandisele Zitha This is what happens in parliament at the inquiry into state capture at Eskom.
Firstly, Khulani Qoma, the former Eskom board spokesperson, says, “I heard from Zethembe Khoza that Minister Lynne Brown is captured. From what Khoza told me, I formulated a theory that the minister is indeed captured. If the minister is not captured, she must then come and tell us she is not.” Then the whole country goes like, “we knew it, this minister is captured.”  Zethembe Khoza, the Eskom CEO, later issues a statement distancing himself from Qoma and says he represented his own interests and views in the inquiry, not those of Eskom.  When we say these people are given money by white monopoly capital to go and lie at these inquiries we are accused of defending corruption. I mean, who believes a witness who says, “ndive ngobani uba ubani wenze oku noku!!” Secondly, Suzanne Daniels (an admitted attorney) tells the inquiry she attended a meeting with Duduzane Zuma, Ajay Gupta and Dep. Minister Ben Martins at Melrose Arch, in Johannesburg on 29 July 2017. She doesn’t produce an ounce of evidence about the meeting. How about a video clip from the complex showing them entering the building? Later on, Ajay Gupta produces his passport showing that between 23 July – 31 July he was in India. He further produces evidence of movements of the jet he boarded to India. He does not end there, he produces a youtube clip showing him to be in India on 29 July. It seems we have become immune to truth in this country. People don’t pay attention to detail, they rely on newspaper headlines. Those who do are accused of defending the Guptas. What business do we have defending billionaires when we do not even have a mere R1000 in our bank accounts!  I really hope legal actions will be taken against Suzanne Daniels, a lawyer, for lying under oath. Those who are close to the inquiry should make sure of this.
