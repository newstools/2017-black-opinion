By BO Staff Writer On 17 October 2017, the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court found that Mr Nkuna as the responsible officer concerned of the JMPD erred in denying permission to the BLF to march and picket on 12 October 2017 outside the Head Office of KPMG Services (Pty) Ltd from 9h00 to 17h00. Consequently, the Court set aside the decision of the JMPD that denied BLF permission to march to and picket on the said date and time outside the Head Office of KPMG. The following article, which is reissued by BO, was previously published on the BLF website in the morning before judgment in the above terms was delivered by the Court on 17 October 2017. Today at 3pm at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court (Ntemi Piliso Street), judgement on the Black First Land First (BLF) application for the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) to unban the march to KPMG shall be handed down. BLF will issue a statement outside court after the judgement. The BLF follow up march to KPMG was banned by the pro-white monopoly capital, Democratic Alliance (DA) controlled JMPD. The illegal banning order was issued on instruction by KPMG. The BLF application was not opposed. BLF is confident that the banning order shall be lifted and our march to KPMG shall be allowed. BLF demands, amongst other things, are that as much as KPMG has withdrawn its report that shows that Pravin Gordhan is a criminal who does illegal things on behalf of white monopoly capital, the corruption prone auditing company must also withdraw the bogus report upon which the 783 charges against President Jacob Zuma are based.
