By BO Staff Writer Very few vocal and progressive black people can say they have never been censored on social networking sites for speaking in favour of blackness. Also, very few black people globally can say that they have never experienced racism online – thus triggering emotions such as anger, humiliation or general annoyance. The creators of DotAfro, a new black social networking site that caters exclusively to people of colour, had this in mind when they were creating the platform. The creators, Mandisa Khanyile and Tumelo Baloyi envision DotAfro as a “social networking site that is a pro-black, safe space free of censorship.” “Some features that make DotAfro unique are that we are Genderless. No men, no women all just human. We have a like and a dislike button. Most importantly we are the first social network to launch voice note for status updates and comments. Our users have a choice they do not have to be limited to text. Lastly Algorithms do not decide who gets blocked/suspended from the site the online DotAfro community does,” the duo said in a statement. “[DotAfro] can be the tool we need to finally unite as Africans around a common Agenda. Our slogan is ‘Free Speech is not a Privilege’ and we have provided the platform to ensure it prevails.” DotAfro is currently in Beta Test phase and will be launching fully on the 18th of November 2017.
