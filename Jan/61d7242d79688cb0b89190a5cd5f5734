By BO Staff WriterPresident Jacob Zuma will comment on the public protector&#8217;s now leaked provisional report &#8220;on the Complaint of Mr Paul Hoffman Pertaining to Alleged Maladministration, Corruption, Misappropriation of Public Funds and Failure by the South African Government to Implement CIEX Report and Recover Public Funds from ABSA,&#8221; at the end of February 2017, the presidency said in a statement.Zuma was granted permission for the extension by public protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The presidency sought the extention to &#8220;finalise consultations with all relevant role players.&#8221;&#8220;The Presidency received the Provisional Report from the Office of the Public Protector toward the end of December last year,&#8221; they said.The provisional report s remedial actions include that ABSA should pay back R2.25 billion to the fiscus.Mkhwebane&#8217;s report is based on an investigation by UK company CIEX, which probed claims that Bankorp, bought by Absa in 1992, had been offered R1.5-billion under the guise of a bailout before the dawn of democracy.Many have been calling for the report to be given the same attention as the white washed State of Capture report. The Black First Land First (BLF) movement has been campaigning to have the investigation fast tracked after being neglected for a number of years by previous public protector, Thuli Madonsela.The movement will be making a submission to the office of the public protector at the end of February.&#8220;In Busisiwe Mkhwebane s suggested remedial action she also proposes that the president should consider a commission of inquiry into apartheid-era looting of the state,&#8221; the Mail and Guardian, which broke the story about the leaked report, reported .Many hope that Zuma&#8217;s comments will back Mkhwebane&#8217;s findings and remedial actions, and finally put the matter to rest.We wait for the comments with baited breath.
