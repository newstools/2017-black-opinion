By BO Staff WriterState airline, South African Airways (SAA), should be investigated for corruption and lack of transformation via a Judicial Commission of Inquiry or Parliamentary Inquiry, the African National Congress Women&#8217;s League (ANCWL) said on Thursday.In a statement, the women&#8217;s league said it noted reports which show that white businesses and individuals have benefited from keeping SAA untransformed. They say there has been a deliberate attempt to keep the State Owned Enterprise (SOE) in white hands.&#8220;This is done consciously to continue with only white owned suppliers being major beneficiaries of tenders at SAA. It is also a plan to ensure that only male occupies senior positions,&#8221; the league said.In its list of concerns, they outline how the airline spends more than R10 billion a year on Jet fuel from 5 suppliers which have been providing SAA with jet fuel for around 82 years.The league also expressed concern about the hiring of American consultancy firm, Bain &amp; Company on a joint venture with South African based Abacus Advisory, on a 3 month contract to &#8216;turn around&#8217; the airline.In 2001, Bain &amp; Co received over R350 million in consultancy fees from SAA over a period of two years. Coleman Andrews, who was the CEO of SAA at the time, was also the CEO of the same consultancy firm which provided services to SAA.&#8220;Former CEO of SAA Coleman Andrews, who received a payment of R232,2 million, tax free, during his two-and-half years at SAA failed to disclose to the Board of SAA during his appointment that he was a founding member of Bain &amp; Company together with his wife,&#8221; ANCWL said.Pravin Gordhan brings back man who destroyed SAAAmong other concerns, the league noted the awarding of all strategic tenders to white companies, noting that only 2% of the company&#8217;s &#8220;R24 billion of annual procurement spent is on black suppliers.&#8221;They also highlighted that, &#8220;retired and resigned pilots from SAA are allegedly still receiving SAA benefits even after being employed by other airlines. This is due to an evergreen agreement contract signed in the 90&#8217;s.&#8221;The women&#8217;s league showed how disproportionately white and male representation of staff is:Read the full ANCWL statement here.
