By BO Staff WriterYesterday, there was high drama in the law enforcement agencies of the country, with a media driven raid on the home of the acting national police commissioner, K homotso Phahlane, by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID).Sources close to the case say the drama is calculated to damage the integrity of the highly regarded Phahlane. What&#8217;s at stake is the job of former police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, which became available after the Claassen inquiry declared her not fit for office.The natural person to take over from Phiyega is Phahlane. However, things have gone political with the position now being contested with the aim of fighting political battles.Robert McBride, who is now being eyed for the job by regime change agents, has been outed as part of the regime change brigade led by Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan. McBride was one of the key persons who attended a fundraiser for Gordhan in Durban when it looked like Gordhan may be charged for corruption.The regime change forces have now roped in the foreigner and murky individual, Paul O&#8217; Sullivan, to assist in the assault on Phahlane.But, in an explosive affidavit against McBride and others submitted as part of a criminal case opened against them, Gauteng head of the HAWKS, Prince Mokotedi, reveals, amongst others, how a secret meeting between O Sullivan, McBride and Shadrack Sibiya (who is employed by the Democratic Alliance (DA) run Johannesburg metro) was held at a house which once belonged to Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir.This house is now bizarrely occupied by O&#8217;Sullivan.The meeting raises serious questions about why a high ranking law enforcement officer would hold meetings at houses of known criminals.Mokotedi further claims that members of the racist Afrikaner group, AfriForum and the equally racist, DA were also at the meeting which wanted, as its main aim, to identifying certain people as targets for vexatious criminal investigations and shaming in the media .It looks like Phahlane was high on the agenda of the conspirators. Mokotedi&#8217;s explosive claims are still to be tested in court but they clearly show how and why McBride is now seen as close to the anti-Zuma forces and willing to cooperate with the DA and even the right wing organization, Afriforum and foreign agents such as O&#8217;Sullivan.The raid on Phahlane&#8217;s home was a well choreographed media event calculated to strengthen the hand of those who want him out.Reliable sources say the DA has given McBride the nod for Phiyega&#8217;s job.The regime change forces hope that the smear campaign against Phahlane will diminish his chances of being appointed as police commissioner and therefore open the door for McBride, who will then use that office to launch a new assault on President Zuma and try to influence the outcomes of the ANC elective conference to ensure that a pro-white monopoly capital president emerges.Phahlane on his part has maintained his innocence and is rated as a good policeman who doesn&#8217;t meddle in political affairs. The assault on his character is likely to increase towards the pronouncement by the president on the Claassen report on Phiyega.It remains to be seen if the smear campaign against Phahlane will be successful.
