By BO Staff Writer Black Opinion brings you the first instalment of its podcast, Black Analysis. In this short podcast “Black Opinion’s Black Weekly News Analysis” we hope to be speaking about stories from the previous week and analysing from our Black Opinion perspective. Last week was the first week of New Year and the 3 main stories that caught our eye were the Eskom/Exxaro debacle, the Matric results and of course the ANC’s January 8 statement.
