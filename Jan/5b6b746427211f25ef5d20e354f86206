By BO Staff WriterLast night, Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan responded to Black First Land First&#8217;s (BLF) High Court application to declare him &#8220;conflicted, compromised and captured by white capital.&#8221; Gordhan, who is the first respondent in the matter, submitted a 340 page answering affidavit to the High Court last night at 17h58.In October last year, BLF lodged a &#8220;Notice of Motion supported by a founding affidavit&#8221; against Gordhan &#8220;and some of the banks.&#8221;In their papers, the movement said they showed how Gordhan is unable to do his job because of the conflict of interest arising from the fact that he has shares in the banks he is meant to regulate as minister. They say this makes him compromised because &#8220;he is beholden to the big banks&#8221;.They also speak about how these same banks insisted he be employed as Minister of Finance in 2015 after Des van Rooyen was appointed by President Jacob Zuma.&#8220;The evidence shows that not only did these banks insist that he be employed as Minister of Finance, but he has shares in the same organisations,&#8221; the movement said.BLF National Convenor, Andile Mngxitama, said &#8220;BLF will study the papers and submit further particulars to the court.&#8221;&#8220;The evidence is very strong against Pravin Gordhan,&#8221; BLF said in a press statement on Friday.According to the press statement, the movement also wants the court to compel Gordhan to comply with the recommendations of the CIEX report which found that billions of rands were stolen from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) by white capital, including the Rupert family.They want Gordhan to provide information they requested on &#8220;R68.6 billion declared by companies as illegally taken out of South Africa in 2003 and the terms and condition that justified the payment of only R26.9 billion in fines by the companies concerned. Gordhan must also indicate what happened to those who didn t disclose monies illegally taken out of the country?&#8221;Gordhan&#8217;s lawyers postponed the matter 3 times before they&#8217;re response yesterday. Asked for comment, the lawyers referred Black Opinion to treasury communications, which indicated that questions would only be answered in 24 hours time.White mainstream media has not bothered to report on the damning application against Gordhan. Black Opinion shall follow the story provide you updates as they come.
