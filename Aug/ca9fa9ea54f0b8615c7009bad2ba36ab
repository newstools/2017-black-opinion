By BO Staff Writer Black Opinion is reissuing the following article which was previously published on the BLF website on 21 August 2017: Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes the deal to buy the Gupta-owned media houses, The New Age in publishing and ANN7 in broadcasting. For a long time in South Africa there has been no black owned media house to counter the propaganda by White Monopoly Capital (WMC), which has complete monopoly over the media space. We congratulate the Gupta family for having built such a solid foundation for a black South African to take over. BLF will support Mzwanele Manyi in this new venture and we call upon him to continue to make The New Age and ANN7 a platform for pro-black alternative news.
Unlike other black business people who do not invest in black liberation, we take our hats off to the Guptas and Manyi for investing in such an important tool for black emancipation â€“ the media. This acquisition will allow for black people to continue speaking their black truth without fear of vilification by the white owned media.
