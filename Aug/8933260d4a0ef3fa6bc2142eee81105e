By BO Staff Writer Knocking its critics to the ground, the African National Congress (ANC) won three out of five by-elections held in the Western Cape, Gauteng, Eastern Cape and Free State. The ANC unseated the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Bergrivier, Western Cape and retained a ward in Ngqushwa, Eastern Cape, with over 80% votes. The ruling party retained a highly contested ward in the City of Johannesburg, shutting down claims that it was losing support on the ground. “The people of South Africa continue to demonstrate their overwhelming confidence in their movement,” ANC Spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa said in a statement. Opposition parties and the white owned media have been propagating the idea that the ANC is loosing support amongst the people, but it has won a number of important by-elections this year. ” Indeed, our strategy to reclaim political power in the Western Cape is slowly but surely yielding positive results. We dare not take for granted the confidence the people continue demonstrate in the movement. Ours is to redouble our efforts in delivering services to the people We thank our volunteers, members and supporters who continued to work tirelessly and ensured this decisive victory for the ANC and the people of South Africa. We equally congratulate the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for, once again, delivering the credible, free and fair elections,” Kodwa said.
