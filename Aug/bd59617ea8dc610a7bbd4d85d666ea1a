By BO Staff Writer Black Opinion is reissuing the following article which was previously published on the BLF website on 22 August 2017: The Black First Land First Student Movement (BLF-SM) continues in its responsibility to build a student movement that takes the struggle for black liberation forward. Black First Land First (BLF) acknowledges and applauds the work done by its student movement in obtaining recognition from the “Recognition Appeals Committee” (RAC) of the Westville campus of the University of KwaZulu Natal (UKZN).  The process for gaining recognition was long and tedious. It was riddled with the typical political gamesmanship associated with new student movements gaining entry into the Student Representative Council (SRC) but the resilience of the BLF-SM leadership at Westville campus ensured success. This recognition follows a successful #BlackWave at the UKZN – Howard College branch in the past week and just as we prepare for #BLFremembersBiko – a time of reflection and inspiration as we struggle to take back the land. Free the mind, take the land! Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF NCC) 22 August 2017 Black First Land First Email: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com
