By BO Staff Writer This media invitation was issued by BLF on its website on 23 August 2017 and is today reissued by Black Opinion as a report of the solidarity action planned and consequently undertaken by BLF. The criminal case against the accused, Carel Kruger, has been postponed to 19 September 2017 for further investigation. Today Black First Land First (BLF) will stand in solidarity with two brave black brothers, Danny Mahlangu and Modiso Dooka, who stood their ground against a racist motorist, Carel Kruger, in Pretoria. Many black people are victims of racist attacks in Pretoria. BLF believes that we blacks have a natural right to defend ourselves against racists. Self defence is a completely legitimate action. BLF will be in court today to express its support towards the accused who are charged with assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. We know that for backs the presumption of guilt and not innocence operates in South African courts as it dispenses white justice. We call on parliament to implement the “Anti-Racism Bill of 2017” as proposed by our movement in the written submission made earlier in the year. All racist organisations like afriforum must be banned. The principle of “blacks can’t be racist” must be observed. Furthermore, all whites found guilty of racism must serve a term of imprisonment of 20 years. Furthermore their land must be expropriated and upon release they must be deported to Europe. BLF’s attendance shall be conducted under the following details: Date: 23 August 2017
Venue: Pretoria North Magistrate’s Court
Time: from 8:30 AM
