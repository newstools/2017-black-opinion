The following article was published earlier today on the BLF website and is reissued below by Black Opinion. Black First Land First (BLF) will today meet with Siphesihle Jele, Simon Masimula, Sipho Coke and Xolani Nkosi, the victims of racism at the hands of First National Bank (FNB). The four former employees of FNB had lost their jobs as a result of private e-mails and WhatsApp communications about their political views relating to the Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane and his white wife, Natalie. BLF recognises these acts by FNB of unfair dismissals as racist bullying so as to try to silence the right our people to freedom of expression â€“ including the right to respond to and call out racism. Black people in this country are brutalised without any consequences. This high handed behaviour by FNB is calculated to inflict fear in black people so as to paralyze them from raising any questions when racism is experienced. BLF will meet with the victims of racism and shall take direct action this week against FNB. BLF does not tolerate racism and will not allow FNB to get away with murder. Land or death!
