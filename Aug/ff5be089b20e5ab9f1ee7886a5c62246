By BO Staff Writer Black Opinion is reissuing the following article which was previously published on the BLF website earlier this morning:  Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the Minister of Finance, Mr Malusi Gigaba, not to be caught up in wasteful and fruitless expenditure claims arising from the legal costs incurred by Pravin Gordhan. It is now a known fact that Pravin Gordhan wasted tax payers money with an “unnecessary” court application for a declaration that he must not, as Minister of Finance, intervene in the relationship between the banks and its clients. The North Gauteng High Court yesterday via the Deputy Judge President, Aubrey Ledwaba, dismissed the application with costs. Black First Land First (BLF) is clear – Pravin Gordhan must pay the costs which includes the costs of two counsel, not the tax payers. The application brought by Pravin Gordhan was malicious, vexatious and totally unnecessary. Gordhan only brought this application as a mechanism to defend the criminal behaviour of the white owned banks which illegally shut down the bank accounts of Oakbay Investments (Pty) Ltd (Oakbay) which is a Gupta owned holding company. Society must not pay for the evil agenda of white monopoly capital that Pravin Gordhan is acting in service of. BLF will write a letter to Minister Gigaba asking him not to engage in wasteful expenditure by using tax payers monies to pay for the legal costs incurred by Pravin Gordhan in bad faith. Let Gordhan pay from his own pocket – after all the application was in his business interests because he has shares in the implicated banks. Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF NCC) 19 August 2017
