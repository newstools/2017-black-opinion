By BO Staff Writer Black Opinion is republishing the following article that appeared on the BLF website on 26 July 2017: Black First Land First (BLF) has dispatched a delegation to Mothutlung, a town in the North-West Province, this morning. This follows a request by the Mothutlung community for BLF to support them in their righteous struggle. The community has shut down the Vametco mine in support of the Mining Charter since yesterday. The mine is located in the land of the community but the community only has 2% shareholding in it. This is unjust and an insult. The community is therefore demanding 30% shareholding in the mine as provided for in the Mining Charter. BLF supports the shut down of the mine. We shall provide all the necessary support to the Mothutlung community so as to ensure that the people own the minerals. All the roads leading to the mine are shut down. They have been barricaded with burning tyres. Let the people enjoy the wealth in their land! Land or death!
