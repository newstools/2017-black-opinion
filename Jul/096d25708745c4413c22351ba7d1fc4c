Minister Mbalula is giving racist journalists false hope. There is no force on earth that can protect racists against the righteous anger of the people. BLF believes that Minister Mbalula s jokes are a distraction from something serious we are busy with currently. This is not netball that we are we dealing with. We are busy with exposing racism and massive corruption cover-up by white monopoly capital.BLF has maintained its position that it supports freedom of expression and freedom of the media but we shall not tolerate any acts of racism being committed under the pretext of practicing journalism. BLF is also clear that any cover-up of white monopoly capital corruption would be fought. The right to protest is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution. This is not a police state.Our advice to the white journalists who have been cautioned to stop racism, is that they must observe the warning given to them by BLF or face fresh and vigorous 24/7 protest action. We shall suffocate them with protest. This is not a joke!
