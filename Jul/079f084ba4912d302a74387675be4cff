By BO Staff WriterOn 29 June 2017 Black First Land First issued a notice which was published on the movement&#8217;s website of its intention to picket Peter Bruce for fabricating news. Black Opinion is republishing the said notice below: The white owned media has unleashed a massive campaign against the truth. It hides white corruption and racism of white monopoly capital and attacks whoever is fighting this injustice. Right now people like the journalist, Peter Bruce, are manufacturing fake news against even the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, because she has ruled that ABSA must pay back the money. BLF also notes the truthless reports against Mineral Resources Minister, Mosebenzi Zwane. This is because he has announced a Mining Charter which empowers blacks against white monopoly capital.We ask Peter Bruce, why has he disappeared the big corruption at Treasury of over R4.3 billion? Also, where is the report on the more than R100 million corruption by KPMG at Treasury?BLF further asks, why has the white media not reported on its front pages about the R100 million corruption admitted by DSTV and in respect of which it was made by the Competition Commission of South Africa to pay a fine. The media is hiding the corruption of people like Johann Rupert, who stole money just like ABSA, from the South African Reserve Bank.The media will not be allowed to be biased and all journalists who are propagandists for white monopoly capital must be named and shamed. We want the truth!BLF will be conducting protest action against Peter Bruce and will start today by picketing him under the following details:Date: 29 June 2017 Address: 46 Galway Road, Parview, Randburg Time: 12:00For enquiries please contact BLF Deputy Secretary General, Tshidiso Tsimong whose contact details appear below.Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC) 29 June 2017Contact detailsBlack First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Facebook: Black First Land First | Twitter: @black1stland1st Website: www.blf.org.zaDeputy Secretary General Tshidiso Tsimong Cell number: 0796680351
